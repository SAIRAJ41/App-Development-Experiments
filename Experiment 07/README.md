# Registration App
The Registration App is a simple form-based application designed to collect user details securely and efficiently. It demonstrates how different input fields and UI components can be combined to create a user-friendly registration process.

## Key Concepts
The application includes a robust Registration Form designed to collect essential user data efficiently and securely. Basic details like Full Name and Email are captured using standard Text Fields. For security, the Password Field includes a handy visibility toggle. We use Radio Buttons for consistent Gender Selection and a Date Picker for accurately capturing the user's Date of Birth. Furthermore, the form includes a standardized Country Input and a mandatory Checkbox for agreeing to the Terms & Policy, ensuring legal compliance before the final Register Button submits the data.
