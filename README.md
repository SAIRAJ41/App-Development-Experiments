## App Development Experiments
Welcome to my repository for app development experiments! This collection showcases my journey and learning process across various mobile and web development frameworks and languages.

üöÄ Experiments List
This repository contains a series of hands-on projects, each designed to explore a fundamental aspect of app development. Below is a list of the experiments included:

1. Simple CRUD Operations in JavaScript/TypeScript
This experiment demonstrates a simple program to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a JavaScript array. It's a foundational exercise for understanding data manipulation.

2. Dart Fundamentals: Input, Output & Loops
A basic program written in Dart to practice core programming concepts such as taking user input, displaying output, and using different types of loops. This serves as an introduction to the Dart language, which is used in Flutter.

3. Android Studio: Counter App
This project involves setting up Android Studio and building a simple counter application. The goal is to get familiar with the Android development environment, basic UI design, and handling user interactions.

4. Flutter: Calculator App
An exploration of the Flutter framework by building a functional calculator app. This experiment highlights Flutter's widget-based architecture, state management, and responsive UI design principles.

5. React Native: To-Do List App
This project uses the React Native framework to create a to-do list application. It focuses on using React components, managing application state, and building a cross-platform mobile app from a single codebase.

7. Registration Form :
This project focuses on building a complete registration form UI that utilizes various input types, including text fields, radio buttons, and dropdown/select menus. The goal is to master form layout, state handling across multiple inputs, and implement basic client-side input validation logic.

8. Navigation App :
An exploration into common mobile app navigation structures. This experiment implements both tab-based navigation (for quickly switching between main views) and a drawer navigation (a side menu for secondary or less-frequently used options). This is a crucial step for understanding how to structure a multi-screen, user-friendly mobile application.

9. SQLite Integration (Calculator & To-Do List Apps)
This experiment demonstrates how to integrate SQLite for offline data persistence in Flutter and React Native apps.
The Calculator App stores calculation history locally using SQLite.
The To-Do List App saves and retrieves tasks directly from the local database.
This project focuses on performing CRUD operations, handling transactions, and maintaining local state efficiently.

10. Firebase Firestore Integration (Calculator & To-Do List Apps)
This experiment extends the local storage functionality by integrating Firebase Firestore for real-time cloud storage.
The Calculator App syncs calculation history with Firestore.
The To-Do List App syncs tasks across devices using Firestore.
It highlights connecting Flutter and React Native apps with Firebase, managing asynchronous data, and implementing cloud-based CRUD operations.

üìÅ Repository Structure
Each experiment is organized in its own folder, containing all the necessary source code files, a README.md specific to that project, and a screenshot of the output. This makes it easy to navigate and understand each individual experiment.
