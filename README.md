App Development Experiments
Welcome to my repository for app development experiments! This collection showcases my journey and learning process across various mobile and web development frameworks and languages.

üöÄ Experiments List
This repository contains a series of hands-on projects, each designed to explore a fundamental aspect of app development. Below is a list of the experiments included:

1. Simple CRUD Operations in JavaScript/TypeScript
This experiment demonstrates a simple program to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a JavaScript array. It's a foundational exercise for understanding data manipulation.

2. Dart Fundamentals: Input, Output & Loops
A basic program written in Dart to practice core programming concepts such as taking user input, displaying output, and using different types of loops. This serves as an introduction to the Dart language, which is used in Flutter.

3. Android Studio: Counter App
This project involves setting up Android Studio and building a simple counter application. The goal is to get familiar with the Android development environment, basic UI design, and handling user interactions.

4. Flutter: Calculator App
An exploration of the Flutter framework by building a functional calculator app. This experiment highlights Flutter's widget-based architecture, state management, and responsive UI design principles.

5. React Native: To-Do List App
This project uses the React Native framework to create a to-do list application. It focuses on using React components, managing application state, and building a cross-platform mobile app from a single codebase.

üìÅ Repository Structure
Each experiment is organized in its own folder, containing all the necessary source code files, a README.md specific to that project, and a screenshot of the output. This makes it easy to navigate and understand each individual experiment.
