## Flutter: Calculator App
This experiment dives into the world of cross-platform app development with the Flutter SDK. The project involves building a fully functional Calculator App, which serves as an excellent way to explore Flutter's reactive framework and widget-based architecture.


## Key Concept:
Widget Tree: Understanding how to compose a UI using a hierarchy of widgets.

Stateless vs. Stateful Widgets: Differentiating between widgets that don't change and those that do, and learning how to manage application state.

Layouts: Using widgets like Row, Column, and Expanded to create a responsive and dynamic interface.

Event Handling: Implementing button logic and connecting it to the app's functionality.

The folder contains all the relevant code files, a dedicated README.md for this project, and a screenshot of the completed app.
