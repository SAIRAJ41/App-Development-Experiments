2. Dart Fundamentals: Input, Output & Loops
This experiment focuses on the foundational concepts of the Dart programming language. The project is a simple command-line application that demonstrates how to handle user input, display output, and utilize different types of loops.

Key Concepts:
Input/Output (I/O): Learning to interact with the user by accepting input and providing feedback.

Loops: Practicing for, while, or do-while loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

This experiment is a great starting point for anyone new to Dart, providing a solid base for more complex projects like the Flutter calculator app. The folder includes the source code, a README.md file, and a screenshot of the output.
