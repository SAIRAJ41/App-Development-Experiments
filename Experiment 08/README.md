# Navigation App
The Navigation App demonstrates two commonly used navigation patterns in modern applications â€” Tab Navigation and Drawer Navigation. These help users move between different sections of the app in an intuitive way.

## Key Concepts
The application employs a dual-strategy Navigation Hierarchy to optimize user experience. Tab-based Navigation is used for the core application flow, allowing users quick access to primary sections like Home or Profile from a persistent location (usually the bottom of the screen). For extended features, such as help documentation or application settings, we utilize Drawer Navigation (a sliding side menu). This combination successfully balances ease of use for frequent actions with comprehensive access to all features, ensuring the UI remains clean and the navigation structure is clear and responsive.
