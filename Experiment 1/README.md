## Simple CRUD Operations in JavaScript/TypeScript
This experiment demonstrates a fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) program using a simple JavaScript/TypeScript array. The goal of this project is to showcase core data manipulation concepts that are essential for any app development, regardless of the framework.



## Key Concepts:
Create: Adding a new item to the array.

Read: Displaying the contents of the array.

Update: Modifying an existing item in the array.

Delete: Removing an item from the array.
