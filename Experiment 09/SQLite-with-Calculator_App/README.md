# SQLite
This experiment extends the basic calculator app (Expt 4) by introducing local data persistence. Using SQLite, the app will store and retrieve a history of calculations, demonstrating how to perform basic CRUD operations directly on the device's storage. This is a practical application of the sqflite package in a Flutter environment.

## Key Features :
Framework: Flutter.
Database: Local SQLite (via sqflite package).
Functionality: Implement CRUD operations to store and retrieve a history of calculations.
Focus: Data Persistence and asynchronous database handling (async/await).
